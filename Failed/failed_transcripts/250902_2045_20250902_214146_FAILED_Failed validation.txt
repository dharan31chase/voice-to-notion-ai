Write email to Meridith about a small win.
Over the last few weeks, I've noticed a remarkable shift in my approach towards work and
following my passion.
I was able to overcome a barrier that had always been a stumbling block for me.
And I was able to express to my wife clearly what I wanted and I was able to give that
permission to myself to work even during a trip.
Something I've usually found really hard to implement before.
We were recently on a trip to Montana with a few friends and every day, despite all the schedule that we had,
I asked for time to work on my product idea that I'm working for and learning and building with AI.
I've built a bot that takes my voice recordings, transcribes them.
And automatically sends it to my Notion tasks and notes database, thereby helping me.
I've built a product that turns voice recordings into organized, actionable notes and tasks in seconds, not minutes.
It's a personal productivity automation tool.
And I have learned the code from scratch and continued staying accountable towards this goal.
And I want to thank you for all the support and helping me achieve this.
Project Eudaimonia.
Task.
