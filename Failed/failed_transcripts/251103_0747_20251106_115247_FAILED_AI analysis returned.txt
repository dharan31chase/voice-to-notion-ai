it's all these personal personal energy management blog it's all these micro
decisions I make throughout the day what I wake up what I do right after I wake
up today I was just walking past Fellini's and I really wanted to get a
really nice pastry and eat something not enjoy but my real errand was to get to
target to get some milk for breakfast feel down on energy well I could make a
micro decision to just stay do a breathing exercise or just like close my
eyes for a few minutes but what do I end up doing? end up smoking up thinking it gives me an
energy I think just eliminating these two or minimizing these two is gonna be a
huge game changer I do feel a little bit stuffy in my nose this morning not in the
sense of having something lodged up there but in the sense of my turbinates feel a
little inflamed it doesn't matter which means my head does feel a little heavy like
right in between my temples it's not a headache this feels like a brain fog
that's settled in there this morning despite using CPAP the entire night which
reminds me the other task that I have to do on this is order the CPAP replacement
supplies I still haven't cleaned the tubing for a while which probably is not a good
thing and that's because of the home remodels I just haven't had a sink and a
nice place to wash it that I did before too much friction too much friction but
before I start I'm gonna try some Naadi Shodhana while I get my morning dose of
coffee in my garden anyway I just finished Naadi Shodhana and a little bit of
Wim Hof and I feel so great with this money I couldn't go to the cold shower just
too freakin cold I'm excited now I want to use the flow timer today and I see how
today goes my goals for today is not to jerk off not to get high and have an
allowance of two peanut balls that for the whole day for my sugar intake in the
last thing is I don't want to skip meals so after my first pomodoro timer I want to
go ahead and do that the question then becomes what do I want to do first the
good life note
