so this morning I got up and I smoked up I wasn't feeling anxious the past few
days I haven't masturbated yesterday my sugar intake was pretty low I just had
like two peanut balls one after lunch and one after dinner so sorry one peanut
ball one after lunch and at night I had fun size M&M pack I didn't snack during the
day and I had reasonably healthy food throughout the day morning I had yogurt
with Siggy's vanilla yogurt with blueberries and a little bit of granola
for lunch I had tuna salad and string cheese and for dinner I had whole tonkotsu
ramen with extra gyozu I think it's called over the pork slices and there were two
eggs in it I think that's a pretty good meal I look at the my energy throughout the
day yesterday one of the things I'm realizing
I was sore yesterday I did try to use the Pomodoro timer not very effective at it
there was a lot going on at the house because of the construction which kind
of enforced breaks from my work sessions yesterday I was also very productive but
I smoked up throughout the day it's a very mild like 19% THC
my nose isn't great I've been hydrating well work has been very energizing I think I'm getting
to see and benefit from some of the systems level thinking I'm coming to rely more and more on Claude
for my coding needs I've been pretty happy with how cloud has been performing so far and with the
memory feature this week I'm very impressed and I think setting up a reliable RAG system is one of my
big priorities because it is such a huge game changer and I think the conversations with Peter and the
interviews have started to go well it's a bunch of things that I am following up on I need to
create a system to do follow-ups with people or reminders to follow up with people with like an
automation or a template for it
like for instance I had reached out to David Cronin it's been more than a week and I want to
check in on them and say hey what's that um I still haven't responded to Aisling
I feel happy I feel very content the therapy session with Dr. Rana
uh went well this is this is the cabinet installation went well I'm pretty happy with the outcome the house
looks pretty good right now I also looked at their cabinet installers set up and took a few pictures
of their equipment and it's kind of
inspiring I want to start uh making cabinetry at least for like better storage system in our
basement uh that'd be a cool like fun weekend project to do it'll be a very good creative project
and I want to get the tools for it and oh I'm excited to do that sometime next year
uh the community is showing up beautifully uh I had tried to minimize my social commitments uh and
Jess has been honoring that really well um and at the same time like people are reaching out and
really trying their best to host us um Matt and Anna had invited us for dinner and a couple of two
Fridays from now uh Nina is coming with us to select paint which is anyway something we had to do which
is just joining us to make our life easier and Nina and Adrian are painting the bedroom next weekend
and JD called and offered to come help to like uh be physical labor and assist with like any moving
which we have to do uh once because the kitchen will be over next week we need to like transfer and
clear out the ADU uh so they can start working on the bedroom uh in the ADU so that's been going good
overall it's very energizing very uplifting very happy conversation with mom has been really good
um uh a couple of things that's on my plate I still haven't set up time for is uh uh to work on
Steven's proposal uh for how he can reduce costs or expenses um I need to check in
with him on the link to this year's roadmap
or any other crucial product launch documents uh
that he has from the past year uh and the financials task and as a meta idea today I want to
do the transcription of all the raw footage there's a lot of real world good examples
and see how the engine performs and then make the roadmap based on that because this is a great uh
example of a great log uh it looks at real world scenarios
I've been doing a little bit of breathing exercise that's also been helping me a lot when it comes to
living a good life
as you can see my nostrils are flat
nostrils are flat the other thing I need to do is set up time with doctors
uh I have an allergist appointment um I need to
go to my primary care and get a bunch of vaccines done
so and also talk to her about like the medical history and whatnot
the other thing I need to do is go check the status of my prozac
so maybe stop stop by the CVS pharmacy today yeah that's a big important and urgent one task
the good life
