**Project**: Epic 2nd Brain
**Status**: Complete
**Session Type**: Planning

---

## Summary

Built comprehensive Strategy Board framework with 9 prioritized initiatives spanning Context Sync Bridge, Legacy AI Integration, and Voice-to-Notion Pipeline. Validated Git Hooks completion via session logs. Created detailed specifications in docs/strategy-board-batch-1.md and batch-2.md. Conducted deep leverage points analysis explaining why each initiative targets specific Meadows hierarchy levels. Confirmed Multi-Project Expansion as highest priority (93.4 score) due to rare #4 Self-Organization leverage point.

## Decisions Made

1. Strategy Board database structure validated - formulas working correctly
2. Multi-Project Expansion is highest priority (93.4) - only initiative with Self-Organization leverage
3. Notion Command Center Dashboard ranked third (76.7) - solid #6 Info Flows + #5 Rules
4. Customer Interview Analysis uses GPT-4 for quality - insights too valuable for GPT-3.5
5. Email integration: Start with Zapier (faster validation) over Gmail API
6. Calendar integration: Google Calendar API, only tagged meetings
7. Leverage point analysis validates priority ranking - #4 Self-Organization rarest and most powerful
8. Git Hooks completion confirmed via Session: 2025-11-08 log
9. RAG Search correctly deprioritized - only single leverage point #6

## Next Steps

1. Manually add 9 initiatives to Strategy Board in Notion (specs in docs/strategy-board-batch-*.md)
2. Delete 3 test entries: Voice Memo Transcription, Energy Tracking, Cross-Reference Automation
3. Add Unblocks/Blocked By relations after pages created (need page IDs for relations)
4. Verify Priority Board view shows Multi-Project Expansion at top
5. BUILD FIRST: Multi-Project Expansion (5 hours) - validates scalability with Legacy AI
6. Test Legacy AI customer interview workflow with new multi-project structure
7. BUILD SECOND: Customer Interview Analysis (6 hours) - after multi-project unblocks it
8. BUILD THIRD: Notion Command Center Dashboard (7 hours) - morning ritual optimization
