# Session: 2025-11-08 - Claude Chat

**Project**: Epic 2nd Brain
**Status**: Complete
**Session Type**: Planning

---

## Summary

Validated Groq integration (130x speed improvement achieved), identified learning gap in tech requirements review process, and refined PRD collaboration workflow between Claude Chat and Claude Code.

## Decisions Made

1. Groq integration validated - 130x speed improvement achieved (vs 10-20x target)
2. PRD simplified to 2-backend architecture (Groq + Local Whisper, removed OpenAI)
3. Identified missing 'Tech Requirements Review Gate' - need user approval before Claude Code implements
4. Context Sync Bridge workflow proven effective - PRD to implementation handoff works

## Next Steps

1. Add 'Tech Requirements Review Gate' rule to Claude Code's memory (ai-assistant/CLAUDE.md)
2. Optional: Retroactive learning exercise on Groq architecture decisions
3. Continue validating Context Sync Bridge with next feature implementation
