# Epic 2nd Brain: Tier 0 Roadmap

Timeline: Nov 8-22, 2025 (2 weeks)

Status: Requirements Defined, Ready to Build

Last Updated: Nov 8, 2025

---

## 🎯 Mission: Context Sync Bridge

The Problem: You're the manual bridge between three disconnected systems (Claude chat, Claude Code, Notion), causing:

- Context loss between sessions (10-15 min/session spent reloading context)

- Repeated copy-paste of requirements/decisions (5-10 events/session)

- No single source of truth for project status

- Manual documentation updates that don't flow bidirectionally

The Vision: World-class product development framework at solo founder scale

- Claude (chat) = Strategic decisions, PRDs (write permission)

- Claude Code = Technical implementation, requirements (write permission)

- Notion = Command center with visual dashboard (read-only, synced from repo)

- Git/GitHub = Single source of truth (version controlled, cloud backed up)

- Automated handoffs via structured documentation

The 100,000X Lens: This is a Tier 0 leverage point - solving context sync unlocks everything downstream (command center, session handoffs, advanced workflows).

---

## 📊 Success Metrics (2-Week Target)

2x Leverage Validation:

- Time saved per session: 10-15 min → 3 min = 7-12 min saved

- Sessions per week: ~10

- Total time saved: 70-120 min/week (1.2-2 hours)

- Setup time: 30-40 hours

- Payback period: 15-30 weeks

Real Leverage (Beyond Time):

- Reduced cognitive load (priceless)

- Preserved decision context (prevents rework)

- Foundation for advanced workflows (calendar, email, etc.)

- Ability to onboard collaborators (future-proofing)

---

## 🏗️ Architecture: Hybrid System

```javascript
GITHUB (Cloud Backup)
    ↓ (git push/pull)
LOCAL REPO (ai-assistant/docs/)
├── prd/ (Claude writes)
├── tech-requirements/ (Claude Code writes)
├── sessions/ (Both write)
├── architecture/ (Mermaid diagrams)
└── ROADMAP.md (Both update status)
    ↓                           ↓
MCP Server               Git Post-Commit Hook
(Claude reads docs)      (Auto-backup + Notion sync)
    ↓                           ↓
CLAUDE CHAT    ←→    NOTION DASHBOARD
(Strategy)              (Visual status, mobile access)
    ↕
CLAUDE CODE
(Implementation)
```

Key Design Decisions:

1. Git/GitHub = Source of Truth: Version controlled, cloud backed up (coffee-spill protection)

1. Local docs/ = Work Here: Fast, structured, version history for rollback

1. Notion = Dashboard: Visual status, mobile access, links OUT to GitHub docs

1. MCP = Mac Power Tool: Claude auto-loads context (with fallback to manual file reading)

1. Bidirectional Sync: Git hooks update Notion, both agents update docs

## 🎉 WEEK 1 COMPLETE! (Nov 8, 2025)

**Status**: ✅ ALL 3 PHASES SHIPPED IN ONE DAY

**Time**: ~7 hours actual vs 16-20 hours estimated (65% faster!)

**What We Shipped**:
1. ✅ MCP Server with 5 tools (read, write, start_session, end_session, search_docs)
2. ✅ Documentation templates (PRD, Tech Req, Session Log, Architecture)
3. ✅ Git hooks → Notion sync (commit → update in <30 sec)
4. ✅ Context Sync Bridge PRD created
5. ✅ Zero blockers encountered

**Key Wins**:
- Context loading: <1 second (target was <3 min) = **99%+ improvement!**
- write_file tool: Claude can create PRDs directly in repo (no more downloads!)
- Git→Notion sync: Fully automated, tested, working
- All templates validated and in active use

---

## 📅 Week 1: Foundation (15-20 hours)

### ✅ Day 1-2: Documentation Architecture (4-6 hours) - COMPLETE (Nov 8, 2025)

Goal: Create structured doc system in ai-assistant/docs/

Deliverables:

- ✅ Folder structure: prd/, tech-requirements/, sessions/, architecture/

- ✅ PRD Template (Claude writes, Claude Code reads)

- ✅ Tech Requirements Template (Claude Code writes, Claude reads)

- ✅ Session Log Template (Both agents write)

- ✅ Mermaid diagram templates

Success Criteria: ✅ Templates exist, sample docs created, committed to GitHub

---

### ✅ Day 1-2: MCP Proof-of-Concept (2 hours) - COMPLETE (Nov 8, 2025)

Goal: Prove MCP works on your Mac before building full system

Phase 1A - Simple Test:

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def read_file(path: str) -> str:
    """Read a file from the ai-assistant repo"""
    # Implementation complete and tested
```

Test: ✅ "Claude, read PRD for voice-to-notion" → Returns full PRD content

Success Criteria:

- ✅ MCP server runs without errors

- ✅ Claude can call read_file tool

- ✅ Content returns correctly

- ✅ All 3 validation tests passed (README, roadmap, error handling)

Fallback Plan: Not needed - MCP working perfectly!

---

### ✅ Day 3-4: Git Hooks + Notion Sync (6-8 hours) - COMPLETE (Nov 8, 2025)

Goal: Automate flow from git commits → Notion updates

Deliverables:

1. ✅ Post-Commit Hook (.git/hooks/post-commit):

  - ✅ Triggers after each git commit

  - ✅ Calls Python script to sync to Notion

  - ✅ Auto-pushes to GitHub (backup)

1. ✅ Notion Sync Script (scripts/sync_to_notion.py):

  - ✅ Parses commit message for roadmap references ([ROADMAP-X] format)

  - ✅ Updates Notion roadmap database (status, last updated)

  - ✅ Creates session log entry in Notion

  - ✅ Links to relevant PRD/tech docs

Success Criteria:

- ✅ Commit → Notion updates within 30 seconds

- ✅ Roadmap status reflects latest work

- ✅ Session logs appear automatically

- ✅ End-to-end test: [ROADMAP-1] successfully updated Notion + created Session entry

---

### ✅ Day 5-6: Claude Chat Integration (4-6 hours) - COMPLETE (Nov 8, 2025)

Goal: Claude proactively fetches context at session start

Phase 3 - Full MCP Server (mcp_server/full_server.py):

**All 5 Tools Implemented & Tested:**

1. ✅ `read_file(path)` - Read any file from repo
2. ✅ `write_file(path, content)` - Write files directly (solves /outputs workaround!)
3. ✅ `start_session(project_name)` - Auto-load context (PRDs, sessions, roadmap)
4. ✅ `end_session(project_name, summary, decisions, next_steps)` - Auto-create session logs
5. ✅ `search_docs(query, doc_types)` - Search across documentation

**Key Innovation**: write_file tool enables Claude (chat) to create PRDs/docs directly in repo without manual download/move steps!

Success Criteria:

- ✅ "Start session: [project]" → Claude loads full context automatically (PRDs, tech reqs, sessions)

- ✅ "End session" → Logs written to docs/ and synced to Notion via git hook

- ✅ Claude can write PRDs directly using write_file tool

- ✅ All 5 tools tested in Claude Desktop (100% success rate)

- ✅ Claude Desktop config updated to use full_server.py

- ✅ Context loading in <1 second (exceeds <3 min target by 99%+!)

### Day 10-12: RAG Search (Repo-Only) (6-8 hours)

Goal: Query project docs instantly without manual searching

Scope: Search only ai-assistant/docs/ (NOT Notion, deferred to Tier 1)

Implementation:

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def search_project_docs(
    query: str,
    doc_types: list[str] = ["prd", "tech-req", "sessions"]
) -> list[dict]:
    """Semantic search across project documentation"""
    results = []
    for doc_type in doc_types:
        docs = load_docs(f"docs/{doc_type}/")
        matches = semantic_search(query, docs)
        results.extend(matches)
    
    return sorted(results, key=lambda x: x["relevance"])[:3]
```

Test Queries:

- "What did we decide about icon matching?"

- "When did we ship the transcription engine?"

- "What are the open questions for the PRD?"

Success Criteria:

- Search returns relevant results in <2 seconds

- Top 3 results include source file + excerpt

- Links back to full document

---

### Day 13-14: Testing + Iteration (3-4 hours)

Goal: Validate 2x leverage achieved

Validation Tests:

1. Context Sync Test:


1. Handoff Test:


1. Dashboard Test:


1. Copy-Paste Elimination Test:


1. RAG Search Test:


Success Criteria: All tests pass, 2x leverage validated

---

## 🚫 Deferred to Future Tiers

### Tier 1 (Weeks 3-4): Visual Enhancements

Why Deferred: Foundation must work first before polishing

- Mermaid diagram auto-generation from architecture docs

- Figma integration for UI mockups (manual links sufficient for Tier 0)

- Advanced roadmap visualizations (Gantt, timeline)

- RAG search expansion to include Notion PARA

### Tier 2 (Weeks 5-8): Advanced Automation

Why Deferred: Requires Tier 0 + Tier 1 infrastructure

- Calendar sync (meetings → session blocks)

- Email pipeline (feedback → roadmap items)

- Text message pipeline (quick captures)

- Voice command integration ("Claude, what's blocking me?")

### Tier 3 (Weeks 9-12): Collaboration Features

Why Deferred: Solo founder first, scale later

- Multi-user support (when hiring)

- Permission layers (PRD vs code access)

- External stakeholder views (sanitized roadmap)

- Client portal (project status sharing)

---

## 🎯 Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: Why Hybrid (Repo + Notion) vs Pure Notion?

Rationale:

- Concern: Notion PARA mixes personal + IP-sensitive content

- Concern: Not purpose-built for dev workflows

- Solution: Repo = source of truth (version controlled, secure), Notion = dashboard (visual, mobile)

- Benefit: Collaborator-friendly, IP-protected, best of both worlds

### Decision 2: Why MCP Server vs Manual File Reading?

Rationale:

- Pro: Automatic context loading (10x faster than copy-paste)

- Pro: Proven technology (Anthropic official SDK, active community)

- Con: Mac-only (can't use from phone/web)

- Con: Cutting-edge (requires proof-of-concept first)

- Solution: Phase 1A proves it works, fallback to manual if fails

### Decision 3: Why RAG Search (Repo-Only) First?

Rationale:

- Leverage: 90% of queries are about current project (not old notes)

- Scope: 6-8 hours (manageable in Week 2)

- Validation: Proves concept before expanding to Notion

- Deferred: Notion integration to Tier 1 (lower priority)

### Decision 4: Why Mermaid (Not Just Figma)?

Rationale:

- Speed: Mermaid = quick iteration during dev

- Version Control: Markdown-based, Git tracks changes

- Collaboration: Renders in GitHub, Notion, VS Code

- Figma: Reserved for polished stakeholder presentations (Tier 1)

- Workflow: Mermaid → commit → auto-render → (later polish in Figma)

### Decision 5: Why Git Post-Commit Hook (Not Pre-Commit)?

Rationale:

- Post-commit: Already has commit hash, message, files changed

- Pre-commit: Would block commit if Notion API fails (bad UX)

- Trade-off: Slight delay (30 sec) vs guaranteed commit success

- Fallback: Manual sync script if hook fails

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: MCP Server Doesn't Work

Impact: Can't auto-load context, back to manual file reading

Probability: Low (Anthropic official SDK, proven)

Mitigation: Phase 1A proof-of-concept on Day 1-2

Fallback: Manual file reading (still better than copy-paste)

### Risk 2: Notion API Rate Limits

Impact: Sync delays if hitting 3 req/sec limit

Probability: Low (small team, batched updates)

Mitigation: Queue system, retry logic

Fallback: Manual sync button in dashboard

### Risk 3: Git Hook Failures

Impact: Commits don't trigger Notion updates

Probability: Medium (network issues, API changes)

Mitigation: Error logging, retry logic, alert on failure

Fallback: End-of-day manual sync script

### Risk 4: Documentation Overhead

Impact: Templates become friction instead of help

Probability: Medium (new habit formation)

Mitigation: Start minimal (3 templates), iterate based on usage

Fallback: Simplify templates if adoption low

### Risk 5: RAG Search Quality

Impact: Irrelevant results, low adoption

Probability: Low (small corpus, focused queries)

Mitigation: Tune relevance threshold, add filtering

Fallback: Manual grep in docs/ (still fast)

## 🎓 Systems Thinking Applied

### Leverage Points Addressed

#6 - Information Flows (High Leverage):

- Before: Manual copy-paste between systems (broken flow)

- After: Git hooks + MCP tools (automated flow)

- Impact: 70-120 min/week saved

#5 - Rules (High Leverage):

- Before: No structure for how agents communicate

- After: Templates, session logs, bidirectional sync rules

- Impact: Consistent handoffs, no context loss

#4 - Self-Organization (High Leverage):

- Before: You manually orchestrate every handoff

- After: System self-updates (commit → Notion, start session → fetch context)

- Impact: Reduced cognitive load, scales to more projects

#3 - Goals (Highest Leverage):

- Before: Goal = "build features fast"

- After: Goal = "build with preserved context and decision history"

- Impact: Better decisions, less rework, foundation for 100,000X

### Feedback Loops Created

Reinforcing Loop R1: Documentation Value:

```javascript
Good docs → Easy context loading → More usage → Better docs → (repeat)
```

Balancing Loop B1: Context Freshness:

```javascript
Context staleness → Session start → Fetch latest → Updated context → (equilibrium)
```

Balancing Loop B2: Roadmap Accuracy:

```javascript
Roadmap drift → Git commit → Auto-update → Accurate roadmap → (equilibrium)
```
