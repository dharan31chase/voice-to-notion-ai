# Voice-to-Notion AI Assistant - Project State & Decisions

## Current Status (Day 2 - August 21, 2025)
- ‚úÖ **AI transcript analysis:** Working (analyzes voice content, categorizes tasks vs notes)
- ‚úÖ **Notion integration:** Connected (can read/write to PARA databases)  
- üîÑ **Smart routing:** In progress (2/4 project detection accuracy)
- üéØ **Next:** Fix project matching, complete Day 2 pipeline

## Key Architecture Decisions Made

### 1. Learning System vs Hard-Coding (Day 2)
**Decision:** AI-powered project detection with learning system roadmap
**Rationale:** Adaptable to changing projects, no maintenance overhead
**Implementation:** Few-shot learning MVP (Week 1) ‚Üí Full learning system (Week 3)

### 2. Manual Review Approach (Day 2)  
**Decision:** Notion-native tags (`üîç AI Review Needed`) vs separate queue
**Rationale:** Keeps workflow in familiar Notion environment
**Implementation:** Low-confidence items get review tag

### 3. Content Processing Strategy (Day 2)
**Decision:** AI-powered routing with intelligent context analysis
**Rationale:** Understands full content context vs simple keyword matching
**Implementation:** OpenAI API with structured prompting

### 4. Icon Selection Approach (Day 2)
**Decision:** Embedded in creation flow with fallback optimization
**Rationale:** Nice-to-have feature shouldn't break core workflow
**Implementation:** Quick AI call with timeout, separate script for optimization

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Transcript Processor** (`process_transcripts.py`) - Analyzes voice content
2. **Intelligent Router** (`intelligent_router.py`) - Project detection & routing logic  
3. **Notion Manager** (`notion_manager.py`) - Creates organized Notion content
4. **Environment** - Python 3.11, OpenAI API, Notion API

### Data Flow
Voice Recording ‚Üí MacWhisper Pro ‚Üí .txt files ‚Üí AI Analysis ‚Üí Smart Routing ‚Üí Notion Content

## Project Roadmap

### Week 1 (Current): Core Automation
- [ ] Fix project detection accuracy (few-shot learning)
- [ ] Complete end-to-end pipeline testing
- [ ] Manual review workflow working

### Week 2: Email Intelligence  
- [ ] Outlook API integration for newsletter processing
- [ ] Smart email categorization and briefing

### Week 3: Learning & Optimization
- [ ] Implement learning system for project detection
- [ ] Correction feedback loop
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Current Challenges
1. **Project Detection:** 50% accuracy (Figma/Canva and Sahil Bloom cases failing)
2. **Tag Logic:** Need to separate duration estimation from tag assignment

## Session Handoff Notes
- **Your PARA Projects:** Green Card, Baby, Product Craftsman, Home Remodel, AI Ethics, etc.
- **Workflow:** Sony recorder ‚Üí transcripts ‚Üí AI analysis ‚Üí Notion organization  
- **Goal:** Reduce daily organization time from 30-45 min to 15 min
