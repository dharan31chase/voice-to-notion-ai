### Data Flow

```
USB Recorder → Orchestrator → OpenAI Whisper → AI Analysis → Smart Routing → Notion → Archive
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- OpenAI API key
- Notion integration token
- ffmpeg and openai-whisper installed

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## ⚙️ Configuration

The system uses YAML configuration files for easy customization without code changes.

### Configuration Files

All configuration is stored in the `config/` directory:

- **`settings.yaml`** - Main application settings (API, paths, features)
- **`projects.yaml`** - Project contexts and training examples
- **`tag_patterns.yaml`** - Tag detection patterns
- **`duration_rules.yaml`** - Duration estimation rules
- **`prompts/`** - AI prompt templates

### Quick Configuration Examples

**Change OpenAI model:**
```yaml
# config/settings.yaml
openai:
  model: "gpt-4"  # Change from gpt-3.5-turbo
```

**Add new project:**
```yaml
# config/projects.yaml
project_contexts:
  - name: "Your New Project"
    keywords:
      - "keyword1"
      - "keyword2"
    description: "Project description"
```

**Environment variable overrides:**
```bash
# Override settings for testing
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4 python scripts/process_transcripts.py
PROCESSING_CPU_USAGE_LIMIT_PERCENT=75 python scripts/recording_orchestrator.py
```

See `docs/milestone-1.1-completion.md` for complete configuration documentation
3. Set up environment variables in `.env`
4. Install external tools:
   ```bash
   pip install openai-whisper
   brew install ffmpeg
   ```

### Usage

#### Option 1: USB Recorder (Recommended)
```bash
python scripts/recording_orchestrator.py
```

#### Option 2: Manual Processing
```bash
python scripts/process_transcripts.py
```

## 🧪 Testing

The project uses pytest for testing. All tests are organized in the `tests/` directory.

### Run All Tests
```bash
pytest
```

### Run Specific Test Types
```bash
# Unit tests only (fast, < 30 seconds)
pytest -m unit

# Integration tests (multi-component)
pytest -m integration

# End-to-end tests (full workflow)
pytest -m e2e
```

### Run with Coverage Report
```bash
pytest --cov=scripts --cov-report=html
open tests/reports/coverage/index.html
```

### Run Specific Test File
```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_parsers/test_content_parser.py -v
```

### Current Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 4 tests for ContentParser (category detection, passive content handling)
- **Integration Tests**: 2 existing tests (orchestrator steps, migration comparison)
- **Target Coverage**: 70% (industry standard)

See `docs/testing-roadmap.md` for the complete testing strategy and implementation plan.
