Analyze this task and estimate duration: "{content}"

Duration Guidelines:
- QUICK (2 minutes or less): Calls, payments, quick Google searches, simple emails
- MEDIUM (15-30 minutes): Research tasks, planning, coordination, writing
- LONG (hours/days): Setup, installation, complex research, multi-step projects

Due Date Logic:
- QUICK tasks: Due today ({today_str})
- MEDIUM tasks: Due end of week ({end_of_week})
- LONG tasks: Due end of month ({end_of_month})

Today is {day_name}, {today_str}.
