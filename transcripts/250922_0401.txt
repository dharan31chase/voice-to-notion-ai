Last night, I had this very interesting dream.
I was part of... I was in this really big arena
next to
an ocean lagoon.
Like... and...
There was water. That's not fresh water.
Sorry, that's not seawater on the side, which is the lagoon water.
And there is a hill behind, and then beyond the hills was the ocean.
And...
Next to the hill was this...
sort of...
really old...
built structure. It felt like a...
you know, some sort of like...
a World War II infrastructure that was like a...
that had like a huge outcrop
or like a roof structure with many industrial...
pillars to hold it up across.
And...
just a lot of dust and old concrete.
Structures in between that seemed like they're either used to be...
held for bunkers or to...
you know, keep sandbags and things like that underneath that
that went into the hill.
And then there were a couple of very narrow accesses
that you could climb across the hill and the hill sort of
met with the roof at one point.
At one point, there were small inlets and very narrow inlets
through and stairs through which you could walk across
the hill and over the roof of this platform
into the side, into the other side of the hill.
And once you get to the other side of the hill, there were
some...
narrow pathways, some shrubs and bushes
and not much else.
And then there was this other concrete structure that lead into
this water spout and this urinal
that I saw, the urinal was for the boys section, but they were girls too.
Anyway, that was those contexts of the stage that was there.
Then underneath, there were multiple teachers and these other students
who were supposed to be dancers and then
there were long lines of 100 plus kids and maybe 30, 40 different lines
of kids who were standing
who first were in a disarray and then we had to organize in a line
like we're standing for an assembly, for like an RSS meet or something like that.
It was not organized by height, which is usually what I was just surprised by
because there are people taller than me in front of me.
And then it was organized by sex.
So the boys were standing in the same line and girls were in another line.
And there was a lot of organization and reorganization of the line.
It took a long time for us to just fall in line.
It felt like hours we were asked to move here, move back, move front.
And then I started at the beginning, went to the end and there was a lot of confusion who was at where.
But there were these teachers and some of the volunteers who were sort of helping us organize.
So I started at the middle and then I ended up going to the left end of the line.
And
somewhere during all of this
and we started, they started modeling some of the dance for us and a friend, the volunteer students who were in
proper like dance gear for their final performance, whereas we were in like uniforms, like white shirt and
and the great trousers, if I remember correctly.
And somewhere along this modeling
I noticed this group of girls start dancing in front and
there was this one girl who was right next, right in front of me
who was performing these complicated moves and roles and all of that.
And she did that, her tops left and I could see her on the pull.
There was no shame on her, but she just pulled it up, but it just was an observation and it was not
just kind of nice to look at, but also I
did not objectify her or demean her or anything of that sort, it was just, oh cool, I got to see her on the pull today.
It was a beautiful one.
And
after all of this, there were like more dances that they were trying to show, but we were towards the end of the session
and I really needed a piece, so I stood up and somehow miraculously got a bike.
And I went over the back and then like around the whole group
and went towards the front of the platform, but on the side.
So I sidestepped them and went towards one of those
exits, the narrow exits to go over because I knew there was a restroom on top, but I had a bike and I went and left the bike
and went up and I saw a few people up there and then I found my way to the restroom and I peed
and I got back
down this one and this was around the time that they were starting to disband for the day.
And suddenly there was this like big pipe on the side of the arena through which there's this like long big fishes, like two or three big fishes that jumped off and fell into the lagoon.
And then suddenly there was this like whole bunch of fishes that created this whole noise as they jumped up and above the water in the lagoon
and there was just like maybe like thousands and thousands of fishes that were doing this and everyone turned to watch the fishes
going to the lagoon and they were going towards and around the hillock.
So I think the lagoon was somewhere connected to the ocean there, but it was an incredible sight to watch the fish bouncing along.
And then, you know, I remembered some high school students as part of the list and I remember failing to check that they were getting priority despite being tall and what not.
I don't know why I felt this sense of resentment towards them.
Anyway, through all of that, and then I went to look for my bike and I finally found my bike and the bike, all both the wheels were missing.
I'm like, this is only 15 minutes. Who stole the wheels of this bike?
And I tried to go and find a teacher to say, hey, my bike's wheels are missing. Do you know that this is security and someone did that?
I said no. Anyway, it was something like that.
Curious to do a dream analysis on this one.
