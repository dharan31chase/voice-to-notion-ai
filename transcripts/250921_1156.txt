Dujian wrote that a single moment is all we need to establish our human will and attain truth.
I never understood this before because my understanding of time was murky and imprecise.
But now that my death is imminent, I can appreciate its meaning.
Both life and death manifest in every moment of existence.
Our human body appears and disappears moment by moment without cease.
And the ceaseless arising and passing away is what we experience as time and being.
They are not separate. They are one thing.
And even a fraction of a second, we have the opportunity to choose
and to turn the course of our action either towards the attainment of truth or away from it.
Each instant is utterly critical to the whole world.
A tale for the time being, note.
