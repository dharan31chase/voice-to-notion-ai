It's been 15-20 minutes since I took a micro dose of LSD.
Immediately after taking it, I felt a little sedated.
It is getting irritable. I wanted things to be in order.
Next to a French Meadow Reservoir near Louis Campground in Tahoe National Forest
and with Abrien, Nina, Ted, Jess, Keith and Alassia.
After a few moments, I felt this need to be away and alone and quiet.
People were chatting next to the lake and I just wanted to get away from it.
So I left and walked back and tried to set up the hammock military line.
It was a near shot of where they'll come back once they've finished it, the lake.
I wanted to be alone and away.
I thought the setting was important. Before we did that, I had to prep work the video.
I found like mild brain waves.
I don't think I'm hallucinating it.
Before I set up the hammock, I cleared all the cones and branches under it between the two trees where I set up the hammock.
I felt almost like nothing.
I want to heal. I want to let go of my trauma. I want to be free from trauma.
But I don't need them as much anymore.
I can keep them.
I don't remember how far I came but I don't want them to be the defining force that hijacks my senses when I want them to be.
Show me the way to healing.
It's maybe 45 minutes since I first started. I just took my second dose, booster dose.
I've been seeing some, been calming down since I lay down in the hammock.
I'm letting my mind weave in and out wherever it goes.
I really want to heal. I want to heal so that I can be a good dad.
Then a good husband.
Wait, right now it just feels sleepy.
Maybe this doesn't sound good in the second wave.
Feels like at least I didn't listen to it again. Maybe not.
