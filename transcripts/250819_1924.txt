Seven powers. Benefits are much rarer than barriers. Barriers are rarer than benefits. The other example for counter positioning that I didn't look at earlier is Netflix versus HBO. When Netflix came out with OTT, HBO couldn't respond to them immediately mainly because they had all this lucrative contracts that they had with the network providers. and if they went OTT that will like sort of sabotage their relationship with the network providers which was a great revenue making uh um revenue and profit making center for them and so they couldn't respond and they waited and waited and waited before they could actually get there the another aspect to think about uh materiality of your strategic advantage of three s's which are superiority significance and sustainability so when you have an advantage or a benefit or even a barrier for that matter how superior is it how significant is it and what how sustainable is it? This is a note.
