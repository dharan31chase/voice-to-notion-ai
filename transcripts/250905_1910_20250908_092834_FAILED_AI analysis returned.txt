it's like when you see a mountain lion if you run it'll chase you so you must
stand your ground instead of turning away from any monster that appears move
toward it stand ground and demand to know what are you doing in my mind what
do you have to teach me remember to let go don't try to hold anything let
everything pass something hard yet something soft remember that that's
what you're dealing with
