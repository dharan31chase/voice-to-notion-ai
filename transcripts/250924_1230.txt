Here are other industries where analytics could possibly play a role in professional
theaters, orchestra, statistical report for orchestras, there's a dance, league and then
opera America, the league of historical American theater and venue managers which is an
international association. In terms of the total addressable market there is more
than 12 million dollars in revenue, there are hundreds today and then five to
12 million now there are hundreds again and then 50k to five million there are
thousands today. Today there are two forums that utilize data and one is the
executive forum which is run by Jordan, it happens on Zoom 12 times a year and
there's one in-person summit where all the executives come, the other is PACC PAC which
is a self-coverning organization and PAC members are recommended but not
mandated to subscribe to the AMS analytics and report. Under PAC post 2020 there was a new
group created called LACNA which is a leadership development in the theater field for performing
arts field and to get more participation of BIPOC in the leadership and we need to
clarify how much what percentage of LACNA members use or subscribe to and why and the third one
is PAVA performing arts ventures association which is an advocacy or business association
which initially started with talking about reporting but they really don't need the
benchmarks and they don't have a lot of use for it today. One of Steven's hypothesis is that
marketing budget is too low, this is under the hypothesis that the people don't know the
features that they want to use, that's something to think about how to is marketing and how does
that marketing take place. One of the other things to consider is the C-suite is not very
much incentivized, their compensation even though in hundreds of thousands is not the reason most
people do this and there is limited upside so there's not a lot of financial incentives that
play into why they do this and most of them don't want to do it strategically, they are very
tactical in how they lead their programs and it's very rare to find a strategic C-suite across the
board in performing arts which is a core issue that they've been trying to combat. One of the
main jobs to be done and the reason why they come and log into this tool are contract negotiations
and when they want to go back and like refer to comparables or go back to the board to revisit
their contractors, C-suite executives usually refer to the tool to benchmark their pay. Right now
the payment structure is monthly but billed every half year and the biggest company is the
12 million plus pay 12k per account, the 5-12 million use 8500 dollars and the 50k to 12 million
pay 4000 dollars per year billed annually. One of the non-negotiables is no episodic payment,
people need to be subscribed to use the service. The two painkillers for why many C-suite use it
today is for board meetings and contract negotiations. In terms of what NEXT is needed when it comes to
analytics. How do you get the product to go into a stable state? Nothing that's working should break
while minimizing costs so that it becomes more profitable within the current product suite which
will give Steven some time to wrap up some of the AMS planning research and the book commitments
and then if it becomes profitable at that point they can reassess whether to invest in the product
if there is a bigger addressable market and how to do that whether it is means pivoting or
improving the existing product or layering on AI on top and you know using it to aid AMS research
whatever be it but before that reduce costs to make it a viable business first and longer term
how do you maximize value out of AMS analytics is the goal. So short term is look at how to not
break what's working while reducing costs and most of the costs today 80% of the costs today
come from just labor and more than 50% of the labor goes to just Jordan. Some of the other things
that we spoke about were what are the usage statistics today for the features how often
to go in how many daily active users monthly active users and how easy it is to find all of this
value. So before that come up with review meeting notes with Steven AMS analytics note
