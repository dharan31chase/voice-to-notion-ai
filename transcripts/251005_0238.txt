When you know about like a nefarious activity going on in your business someone
stealing is some fallout that's going to be expected because of some poorly
designed feature or leakage or whatever it is that is going to expose your
business to some amount of backlash the clock starts ticking the moment you know
about it and then you need to be decisive about the path that you take
how are you going to handle the situation is going to be put under a
time crunch because the longer you take the more you expose yourself to the
rest because now you're sitting with the knowledge of what is wrong and not
taking any action on it so as the founder one of your core duties is to
address the issue in the way that you best see it rather than bury the issue
or delay the issue so be decisive
