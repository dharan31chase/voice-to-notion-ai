Learning to build four critical skills for an innovator or an entrepreneur.
Empathetic perspective.
People with this skill can detach from their own perspective and see the subtle differences
between the many different perspectives surrounding their thing internally and externally.
Uncovering demand.
People with this skill can detach from their product or services and look at the demand
side of the equation, seeing the struggles, context and outcomes.
Causal structures.
People with this skill have a dominant view of how the world works based on cause and
effect.
Prototyping to learn.
People with this skill know that they do not have all the answers and run tests to get
empirical data to discover and build new theories instead of relying on existing theory and
testing hypothesis.
Using tradeoffs.
People with this skill understand that they cannot do everything and a skill at making
essential tradeoffs to launch a product that is not perfect.
Empathetic perspective.
It encapsulates the notion that there is not just the external customer perspective, demand
side and the internal company perspective, supply side, but the many different perspectives
within both supply and demand.
And there are subtle differences between these many different perspectives.
Innovators and entrepreneurs have the ability to disconnect or mute from their own perspective.
And see, hear, listen and feel from the other's point of view without judgment.
You're not trying to convince your kid that they shouldn't need some interstops.
You accept their perspective without judgment and make tradeoffs along the way.
How do you extract perspective?
Context.
When something feels irrational, it becomes rational with context.
A keyword when something feels irrational to use is, hold on, I'm confused.
So you can dig deep and get meaningful answers.
Two, contrast.
Providing contrast leads to greater understanding.
Use the bracketing technique.
Why did you switch employers?
Why not just find another role with the organization?
Three, unpacking.
Each person's definition of the word fast or easy or healthy is entirely different
from another's.
There's no fast, it's only faster than, there's no healthy, it's healthier than, there's
no easy, it's easier than.
For energy.
It's not just what people say, but how they say it.
Do they accentuate words?
Do they intonation go up or down?
When you hear emotional energy stop and ask the question, wait, tell me more about that.
Why is that important?
Five, analogy.
When people hit a wall and not have that language to express their thoughts completely, don't
push.
Use analogies.
The four forces influencing the progress of a customer.
The push of the situation.
Struggling moment for someone looking for a new job.
To magnetism, the magnetism of a new solution, just the pull of the new solution, the moment
they realize there might be something better, a new job that could help them make progress.
The anxiety of the new solution.
The thing is despite the struggle at the current job, the new solution creates.
Anxiety is about the unknowns of the new role.
Because anxieties are important because they hold people back from making progress.
And lastly, the habits of the present, these are things about the current job that the
person may like.
