There were three times today that I felt a loss of energy.
Before going to the gym,
after coming back from the gym.
And now, in the evening, when I am going to find out.
Today was a really good day.
I got a lot done.
I feel very proud of myself.
I think it is possible to do.
I feel very proud of myself.
I feel very proud of myself.
I feel very proud of myself.
I feel very proud of myself.
I feel very proud of myself.
I feel very proud of myself.
I feel very proud of myself.
I feel very proud of myself.
I feel very proud of myself.
I feel very proud of myself.
