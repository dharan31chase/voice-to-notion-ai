MCP is model context protocol and it has two components per to it.
It provides context to the AI agents that is interacting with it and tools.
The context is basically a standard way to retrieve external contexts which is things
like documents, knowledge base entries and database records.
It can also execute actions or tools like running a web search or calling an external
service or perform some calculations.
MCP server has three primitives and the first one is tools which is one of the first primitives
and it includes things like a weather service that's basically discrete actions or functions
that AI can call.
Another primitives are resources which are basically read-only data items or documents
that server can provide and then there's a prompt template which is another type of
primitive which are predefined templates for prompting.
An API on the other hand is just application programming interface where a client with
the API acts as an abstraction layer that separates the client from a tool that does
a specific function.
For example a payments API, one of the most common standard HTTP based frameworks at
APIs uses called the RESTful API and they invoke certain functions.
Get to retrieve data, post to create data, put to update data and delete to remove data.
It's just the standard HTTP language for how to use or invoke an API.
The difference between MCP and API is that it's purpose built for LLMs versus APIs are
general purpose and they do something called dynamic self-discovery and basically it's
an MCP client can ask an MCP server, hey what can you do and it can give back a description
of all the available functions and the data that the server offers.
